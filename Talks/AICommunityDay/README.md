# AI Community Day - Building a Copilot for Dunder Mifflin

This is a talk I gave at [AI Community Day](https://www.aicommunityday.nl/). The talk was in English.

## Talk Title

### Building a Copilot for Dunder Mifflin

## Abstract

Copilot is everywhere and it's getting more and more interesting to build your own Copilot using your own data. But where and how do you actually start? Which options are there to make your data available and how can you keep improving your Copilot?

In this sessions we'll answer these and more questions while building a Copilot for Dunder Mifflin, everyone's favourite paper sales company. As Michael Scott would say: "And I knew exactly what to do. But in a much more real sense, I had no idea what to do."
